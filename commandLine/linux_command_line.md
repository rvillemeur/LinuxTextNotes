Vim est un éditeur de texte bien intégré dans le terminal et avec l'environnement unix
Emacs est un environnement d'édition de contenu textuel. Il replace plusieurs outils

the "everything is a file" dates back to the very early days of UNIX - 
the late 1960s / early 1970s. One thing it did was simplify the operating system
 in the sense that you could either write to or read from pretty well everything 
 in the system in much the same way - which became very handy when networking 
 started to happen.

Windows (modern / NT-family), on the other hand, has a lot to owe OS/2 with it's 
more "everything is an object" philosophy. One advantage of this, is that when 
you 'talk' to the object, it will 'know' what to do with what you are asking it 
for / to do. The downside though, is you need to know how to ask it to do what 
you want it to do.

While potentially more powerful and more flexible, it does give up simplicity.

edit: these are VERY BROAD brush strokes - not a deep analysis / critique


Torvalds has corrected this by saying it is not exactly "everything is a file", 
it is more like "everything is a handle". This means there is an API that is 
similar to opening, reading and writing a stream of bytes but it does not 
define the interactions beyond that.
